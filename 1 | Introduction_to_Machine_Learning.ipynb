We'll be glossing over a brief summary of various AI and Machine Learning concepts, and check out some examples of the most basic foundation of machine learning models, starting from regression models. If you are new to Python or data science, we recommend that you go through this notebook in its entirety, since it will set you up well for everything else."

        "Machine learning, generally speaking, is the idea of **estimating a solution by applying an algorithm to data without explicit instruction**. A question you may have, then, is *What situations strictly require machine learning solutions rather than a well-designed algorithm?*\n",
        "\n",
        "> Tasks such as MRI scans, face recognition, voice recognition, speech recognition, and generative AI are examples of these cases. You could say that you can develop an algorithm to handle these, but in the case of face recognition (as an example), there are simply too many edge cases that an algorithm may never exist, or warrant the gargantuan effort in comparison to simply training a machine learning model to automate that task.\n",
